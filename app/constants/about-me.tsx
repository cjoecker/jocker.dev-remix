			Hey, I'm Christian, but my friends call me "Joker". Feel free to do the
			same. But I need to tell you that I'm bad at telling jokes.

		<Paragraph>
			I discovered my passion for programming when I was 9 after my father gave
			away my beloved dog. To honor his memory, I built a website filled with
			pictures of him. That's where my love affair with coding began. During
			high school, I took several graphic design courses and developed a strong
			interest also in UI design.

			In my previous role as a consultant, I specialized in developing custom
			web applications. There, I had the opportunity to work for big companies
			across various industries like automotive, tourism, airlines, robotics,
			and medicine. Unfortunately, my previous projects were confidential.
			That's why I don't have a portfolio here yet. After years of experience in
			large corporations, I've ventured into freelance work.

			I would love to hear from you and discuss our next project!
